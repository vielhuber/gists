### Example app

- This app caches all static assets
- It requests a php backend and fetches data, which can be edited in the frontend
- On every field change it stores the changes inside a queue (without posting it); You can sync manually
- If offline, the latest cached data is shown
- The cache gets updated on every successful call
- The queue is applied in the frontend either to the cache (if offline) or to the live data (if online) to show the user the latest input values

Gtbabel automatically translates your html/php pages – server sided!

== Description ==
Gtbabel...
-   extracts on every page load any page into logical paragraph tokens.
-   static and dynamic content is deliberately treated the same.
-   all tokens are replaced (if available) by it\'s translation before rendered.
-   the tokens get dumped (if not available) into gettext, where they can be translated.

== Installation ==
1. Make sure you are using WordPress 5.3 or later and that your server is running PHP 7.2 or later (same requirement as WordPress itself)

2. If you tried other multilingual plugins, deactivate them before activating Polylang, otherwise, you may get unexpected results!

4. Go to the new menu item \"Gtbabel\" and set all settings

5. Optional: Edit auto translations in the new locales folder

6. Enjoy!

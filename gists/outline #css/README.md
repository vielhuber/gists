## outline

#### example
```css
outline-style: double;
outline-color: #000;
outline-width: 10px;
outline-offset: 8px;
```

- difference between outlines and borders: outlines do not take any space and can be non rectangular
- outlines should be used for accessibility
- setting outline: none should be avoided

#### notes
- ***rule of thumb (if you don't have to handle edge cases): use e.preventDefault(); at the end of the function***
- the ordering of ```e.preventDefault();``` (if on top or bottom of function) is irrelevant
- the ordering of ```return false;``` is important because the function immediately returns
